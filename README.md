## Statistical Modelling of Swine Flu Outbreak Data

The data were collected on a random sample of people to ascertain what factors influenced change during a Swine Flu outbreak. The variables collected were:

1. *Behaviour*   - Whether the person changed behaviour relating to hygiene(yes or no).
2. *Gender*      - Gender of the person.
3. *Age*         - Age category of the person.
4. *Severe*      - Whether the person believed the consequence of contracting Swine Flu were severe.
5. *Information* - Whether the person believed the information about Swinr Flu was adequate.


Tasks:
Task 1: Read the data unto R using seperate vectors Gender, Severe, Information, Age, number of people, number of people that changed behaviour. Apply appropriate numeric codes.

Task 2: Conduct primilinary analyses and draw tentative conclusions.

Task 3: Fit a logistic regression model to the numbers of behaviour changes using the other four variables as explanatory variables. Use forward selection to consider all possible two-way interactions. Use likelihood ratio test to assess the significance of these interactions.

Task 4: Present the final model.

Task 5: Perform diagnostics, presenting appropriate measures and graphics in an appendix. Interpret and suggest appropriate actions, if any. Are there any issues with overdispersion or sparse data? Interpret in terms of your final model(significance, direction and size of effect).
